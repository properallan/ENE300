    "In this implementation, we first define the fitness function that we want to optimize (in this case, a simple function of two variables x and y). We then set the genetic algorithm parameters, including the population size, number of generations, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of parents to select for mating.\n",
    "\n",

We select the parents for mating based on their fitness, and create the offspring population through crossover and mutation.\n",
